# <img src="https://github.com/4rminParvin/4rminParvin/blob/main/Wave.gif" width="30px"> Hello, folks!

👋🏽 My name is Armin.

🎓 I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature.

🌃 Based in Tehran, I have a burning passion for Technology.

📚 After teaching music and English for more than a decade, I decided to pursue my passion - technology. Additionally, a close friend of mine recommended coding to me, something that I, having had a background in coding, had adored for a lifetime. I used to learn QuickBASIC when I was a kid.
Python was my first choice, which I started to learn alongside algorithms and data structures. Then, I went on to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Right now, I am working as the email marketing manager and campaign manager at WatchThemLive, also further expanding my knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, and full-stack web development in the meanwhile.

💻 As for my future, I hope to work as a machine learning and deep learning engineer and a full-stack web developer in a high-performing team.

🎶 In my free time, you can find me reading literature, studying philosophy, and learning whatever I can.

💪🏽 Efficient learning, problem-solving, and teamwork are some of my points of strength.
